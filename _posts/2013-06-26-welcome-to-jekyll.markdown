Funny... after thinking for months to start a blog to share my personal thoughts and encounters during web development I finally found the time to test out the new [Jekyll][jekyll] blogging engine.
(Well, Jekyll isn't new at all but they recently released version 1.0 when I thought it's finally time to try it out).

That said, I found it ridicoulous easy to install and set up in a couple of minutes. I think even without ruby knowledge it should be pretty straightforward if you have any developer background.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets out off the box using the famous `Pygments`:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Pretty neat, isn't it!

So, here it is, my new blog, finally - still have some design tweaks to do so see you in a bit...
