My expertise is web development, both frontend and backend. I love writing Javascript, HTML5, Sass, etc. I enjoy picking up new technologies, though it is impossible to follow everything at the current pace in web dev world.

Currently I spend a lot of time writing Angular.js, before that I focused on Backbone and jQuery. Still nothing beats vanilla JS.

On the backend I tend to use Node.js w/ Express and Nginx, before that I used Ruby on Rails for a while, but writing "Full Stack" Javascript is just too convenient. In a previous life I used to build websites with Typo3 and PHP.

I am also building mobile applications with Cordova and the Ionic Framework, which is lots of fun. I could not live without my beloved sublime text 2.
When I am not programming, I like DJing, running and climbing.
Feel free to contact me if you want to work with me, I am always interested in exciting projects.
