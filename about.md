My expertise is web development, both frontend and backend. I love writing Javascript, HTML5, Sass, etc. I enjoy picking up new technologies, though it is impossible to follow everything at the current pace in web dev world.

At the moment I spend a lot of time writing Angular.js, before that I focused on Backbone and jQuery. I value the right tool for the right job over the latest alpha of hype.js.

On the backend I tend to use Node.js w/ Express behind Nginx, before that I used Ruby on Rails for a while, but writing "Full Stack" Javascript is just too convenient, especially with the JS ecosystem and community growing stronger from year to year.

I am also building mobile applications with Cordova and the Ionic Framework, which is lots of fun. I work on OSX with my beloved sublime text 2 editor and iTerm.
When not programming, you can find me hanging out with my friends, running, cooking or DJing (I am an avid Vinyl Collector).
Feel free to contact me if you want to work with me or just talk web dev, I am always interested in exciting projects.
