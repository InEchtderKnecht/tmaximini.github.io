My expertise is web development, both frontend and backend. I love writing Javascript, HTML5, Sass, etc. I enjoy picking up new technologies, though it is impossible to follow everything at the current pace in web dev world.

Currently I spend a lot of time writing Angular.js, before that I focused on Backbone and jQuery. Still nothing beats vanilla JS.

On the backend I tend to use Node.js w/ Express and Nginx, before that I used Ruby on Rails for a while, but writing "Full Stack" Javascript is just too convenient. In a previous life I even built websites with Typo3 and PHP.

I am also building mobile applications with Cordova and the Ionic Framework, which is lots of fun. I could not live without my beloved sublime text 2.
When not programming, you can find me running, DJing (I am an avid Vinyl Collector) or hanging out with friends.
Feel free to contact me if you want to talk web dev, I am always interested in exciting projects.
